BS"D - On August 18, 2017 (26 Av 5777) while visiting the Ohel of the Baba Sali this idea came to me. The goal is to help people to read important segulot texts faster by scrolling them at their fastest reading rate. B"H this will help more people say the whole book of Tehillim, Tikkun Klali and Parshat HaMan. Shai.Spetgang@gmail.com
